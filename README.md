Hi, I’m Srinivasan Rangarajan, a passionate Frontend Developer with 4+ years of experience crafting dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. My journey started with a love for coding and technology, and today, I take pride in turning innovative ideas into seamless digital experiences.

At AT&T, I contributed to creating high-performance web applications, driving a 25% increase in conversions and 30% faster page loads. From server-side rendering that improved SEO to orchestrating efficient API workflows with Node.js, I’ve always enjoyed finding smart, scalable solutions to complex problems.

Before that, at Accenture, I worked on transforming eCommerce platforms, building reusable React.js components, and automating workflows that saved countless hours for my team. Beyond coding, I thrive in roles where I can mentor and guide others, fostering a culture of collaboration and growth.

What I bring to the table:
-> Expertise in React.js, JavaScript (ES6+), and modern frontend tools.
-> A problem-solving mindset, with a proven track record of improving performance and scalability.
-> A passion for building clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
-> Leadership skills honed by mentoring teams and delivering results in fast-paced environments.

Why I love what I do:
I believe the best web applications aren’t just functional—they’re delightful. Whether it’s enhancing user experiences, optimizing performance, or leading a team to success, I’m driven by the impact my work has on people’s lives and businesses.

Let’s connect if you’re as excited about building future-ready web solutions as I am. I’m always up for a challenge and a good conversation about tech, innovation, or how small tweaks can make a big difference.
